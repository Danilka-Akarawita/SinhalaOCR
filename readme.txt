Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a key problem within the domain of speech and text recognition, where the objective is to automatically convert text present in images into machine-readable digital text. OCR technologies are widely used in document digitization, automated data entry, assistive technologies, search indexing, and archival of printed materials. While OCR systems for high-resource languages such as English have reached a high level of maturity, OCR for low-resource and complex scripts remains an open research challenge. Sinhala OCR is particularly important in the Sri Lankan context, where large volumes of printed and scanned documents exist only in Sinhala script.
